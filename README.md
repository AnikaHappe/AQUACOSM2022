The presented figures and statistics are used in the publication „Do the rate of temperature change and timing of nutrient availability impact the growth and stoichiometry of a natural marine phytoplankton community?“ (DOI follows after publication of the manuscript). The associated data can be openly accessed via PANGAEA (DOI follows after moratorium of the data is alleviated). 

The script „AQUACOSM2022_Fig2_Fig3_Script1.R“ calculates linear growth rates and log response ratios (LRRs), and then produces interpolated response surface plots of the growth rate and LRRs. 

The script „AQUACOSM2022_Fig4_Script2.R“ produces the different parts (separated by temperature rate) of figure 4 of the publication, plotting growth rate over temperature and using the nutrient scenarios as colors. It uses the openly available input file from PANGAEA.

The script „AQUACOSM2022_Fig5_Script3.R“ creates the different parts (once over the entire range of the N:P supply ratio and once as a sub-section) of figure 5 of the publication. It uses the openly available input file from PANGAEA.

The script „AQUACOSM2022_Statistics_Table2.R“ (for the rate of temperature change) and „AQUACOSM2022_Statistics_Table3.R“ (for the timing of nutrient addition) use the available input data from PANGAEA and produce the statistics (GLMs) for the publication.
